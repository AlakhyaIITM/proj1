**Chicago GitHub Users Analysis (100+ Followers)** 

**Data Scraping Explanation**

Utilized the GitHub API to scrape profiles of users located in Chicago with over 100 followers. Data was cleaned using Pandas and scikit-learn, where "NaN" values were imputed and boolean fields were standardized to lowercase for consistency.

**Interesting & Surprising Findings**

Niche languages (e.g., Assembly, Lua) seemed to attract a dedicated follower base.
Users without profile bios had an unexpectedly high average follower count.
The "hireable" status did not show a clear correlation with follower count.

**Developer Recommendations**

Utilizing popular languages such as Python, JavaScript, or SQL can help increase visibility, attract stargazers, and expand community reach.
Adding detailed licenses to repositories is recommended for promoting reusability, transparency, and legal protection across projects.
